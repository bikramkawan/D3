                <h1>About the Visualization</h1>
                <p>This visualization is an interactive slideshow which walks the user through gun crime statistics by
                    US state. How high is gun crime across the US - and which states have the worst figures? The
                    violence debate specifically relating to Gun violence has plagued the urban cities for multiple
                    decades and states with larger population often has a high rate of gun crimes and other forms of
                    violence. The reason why I choose this dataset is to bring more awareness that this will continue to
                    be a major problem in the US if the government fails to pass gun reforms because The US has the
                    highest gun ownership rate in the world - there are 89 guns for every 100 Americans, compared to 6
                    in England and Wales.</p>
                <h2>Recommended Settings</h2>
                <p>As the visualizations use a preset static canvas of 1024x768 pixels, the viewing size of the
                    interactive visualization is at least 1280x800 pixels to accommodate the surrounding text and scene
                    elements.</p>
                <h2>Working with the Dataset</h2>
                <p>The dataset was about 100 MB in size and the challenge was to converting to excel and clean it and
                    then converting to Json in order to upload the data using D3.Js script and deleting some data that
                    did not show any relevance to the message that I am trying to convey to the user.</p>
                <h2>Templates Scene</h2>
                <p>The use of CSS and FullPage.js allows for a cohesive template look for the interactive visualization.
                    Each page is transitioned using the same method and text elements are kept the same (font size and
                    family). Additionally there is a page navigation bar on the right side which allows users to skip
                    between different slides. The tooltips which are triggered when a user moves their mouse over the
                    navigation alters the display parameters for each navigation menu item.
                <h2>Annotations</h2>
                <p>Annotations have been used in all three visualizations with a similar process of using triggers to
                    change the hidden paramenter of
                    the annotation. For example, the Line Chart Visualization has an initial state of the hidden
                    parameter which controls the display
                    of the annotations set to false. As a user uses the brush bar to trigger changes to the line chart
                    visualization x-axis
                    parameters, it also changes this hidden parameter to true. In turn the annotations disappear until
                    the user resets the brush bar
                    to zero - thus zooming out back to the default visualization parameters.</p>
                <h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
                <p>Both parameters and triggers are used in all of the three visualizations. For the Bubble Chart
                    Visualization, parameters for the
                    x,y co-ordinates of each bubble are set to an initial central position for the All Reviews
                    Visualization. As a user selects menu
                    items to chose between All Reviews, Reviews by State and Reviews by Stars, it triggers the change of
                    bubble’s x,y co-ordinates
                    parameter to their respective groupings.</p><br/>
                <p>In Zoomable Sunburst Visualization, each mouse click on a region is a trigger for the path and arc
                    parameters. By clicking within
                    a region, you can zoom into the data to take a look at the information underneath. Clicking the
                    centre circle will trigger the
                    parameters to return to its values one up in the hierarchy.</p><br/>
                <p>For Line Chart Visualization, parameters are set for each Restaurant Category. These parameters are
                    triggered to be updated as the
                    mouse moves over the visualization, providing the user with a snapshot of the amount of check-ins in
                    a given time. A secondary
                    parameter and trigger set is the brush bar below the line chart. This bar allows the user to zoom
                    into the data to show a closer
                    look of the data. By clicking a set space on the brush bar, it triggers the x-axis parameter of the
                    line chart to be updated to a
                    ratio of the same selected section of the brush bar.</p>

                <h1>The Gun Dataset</h1>
                <p>​​The latest data from the FBI's uniform crime reports provides a fascinating picture of the use of
                    firearms in crimes across America. The Gun crime dataset really gives in depth information on
                    different types of crimes which involved: Handgun, Rifles, Shotguns, Firearms (type unknown), Knives
                    or cutting instruments, Other weapons Hands, fists, feet, etc.2. You (the user) as you interact with
                    the slideshow, you will quickly find out that Handguns and Firearms are among the deadliest in the
                    US. Furthermore, you will see a trend in murders from 2009 to 2011 where crimes in the US continue
                    to rise and the data will vary based on the population in each state. President Barack Obama was
                    under pressure to tighten gun laws after following the disclosure by police that the Newtown gunman
                    used a semi-automatic assault rifle equipped with "numerous" high-capacity magazines holding
                    hundreds of bullets to carry out his massacre of young children. Unfortunately, Congress failed to
                    act and The National Rifle Association, the largest and most influential of the gun rights lobby
                    groups, has been similarly silent after each massacre and the murder figures themselves are
                    astounding for Br its used to around 550 murders per year. In 2011 - the latest year for which
                    detailed statistics are available - there were 12,664 murders in the US. Of those, 8,583 were caused
                    by firearms. The FBI crime statistics are based on reports to FBI bureau and local law
                    enforcement. </p>
