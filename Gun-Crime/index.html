                <h1>About the Visualization</h1>
                <p>This visualization is an interactive slideshow which walks the user through gun crime statistics by
                    US state. How high is gun crime across the US - and which states have the worst figures? The
                    violence debate specifically relating to Gun violence has plagued the urban cities for multiple
                    decades and states with larger population often has a high rate of gun crimes and other forms of
                    violence. The reason why I choose this dataset is to bring more awareness that this will continue to
                    be a major problem in the US if the government fails to pass gun reforms because The US has the
                    highest gun ownership rate in the world - there are 89 guns for every 100 Americans, compared to 6
                    in England and Wales. Moreover, the dataset will show data that I have pulled from 2009-2011 and
                    it will show in detail about murder trends in the United States.</p>
                <h2>Working with the Dataset</h2>
                <p>The dataset was about 100 MB in size and the challenge was to converting to excel and clean it and
                    then converting to Json in order to upload the data using D3.Js script and deleting some data that
                    did not show any relevance to the message that I am trying to convey to the user.</p>
                <h2>Elements of Narration</h2>
                <h2>Website Scene Overview</h2>
                <p>I used ccs and JavaScript to develop this static site and I chose to do interactive slideshow.
                    Furthermore, I used scroll to transition between each page and I kept the content of the text element
                    the same as far as font size.  Moreover, as you navigate the bar on the right side,
                    the page will transition to each slide which will display the charts that I have selected for my overall
                    project. I have used the following 3 types of charts: MAP, BUBBLE, BAR and tooltips are used on e
                    very chart for the user to mouseover and gain significant information on the statistics that I have gathered.</p>
                <h2>1. Annotations</h2>
                <p>Various tooltips, Filters, and labels were used for my data visualization; the charts will show 3 areas
                    where the user can focus based on the filtered year from 2009-2011 for each type of charts as you mouseover,
                    you will discover that the tooltip will give you more insight on the data.</p>
                <h2>2. Parameters and Triggers</h2>
                <p>The main parameters of this story are total number of murders by state, region, and by the type of weapons
                    for examples handguns has caused a lot more murders than knives and other types of weapons and the tooltips
                    will outline my findings.</p><br/>
                <p>For the USA Map, I used colors red and filters and tooltips to display the data, the darker the color the greater
                    the total number of murders associated with to each state for example New York and California will have a greater number of
                    murders because their population is greater, and this also goes for the types of weapons that is used to commit crimes,
                    handguns vs robberies are more accessible to these states.</p><br/>
                <p>In Zoomable Sunburst Visualization, there are 2 categories total murders which will display all of the states together and as
                    you mouse over the bubble, it will display tool tips with the name of the state and other types of data associated with it and
                    the bigger the bubble the greater the number of murders for that state. Murder by Region is another type which I
                    thought would be interesting to group the states regionally: Northeast, South,  Midwest, and West so the user can drill-down deeper.</p><br/>
                <p>For the bar Chart Visualization, X and Y axis are properly labeled showing types of weapons that were used
                    and total number of murders relating to these various weapons. I also added filter, so the user can choose between
                    the years 2009-2011. The tooltip will be used to show the 3 states that I have chosen to show the highest number murders vs
                    the lower number of murders on each bar on the chart.</p>

                <h1>The Gun Dataset</h1>
                <p class="long-text">​​The latest data from the FBI's uniform crime reports provides a fascinating picture of the use of
                    firearms in crimes across America. The Gun crime dataset really gives in depth information on
                    different types of crimes which involved: Handgun, Rifles, Shotguns, Firearms (type unknown), Knives
                    or cutting instruments, Other weapons Hands, fists, feet, etc.2. You (the user) as you interact with
                    the slideshow, you will quickly find out that Handguns and Firearms are among the deadliest in the
                    US. Furthermore, you will see a trend in murders from 2009 to 2011 where crimes in the US continue
                    to rise and the data will vary based on the population in each state. President Barack Obama was
                    under pressure to tighten gun laws after following the disclosure by police that the Newtown gunman
                    used a semi-automatic assault rifle equipped with "numerous" high-capacity magazines holding
                    hundreds of bullets to carry out his massacre of young children. Unfortunately, Congress failed to
                    act and The National Rifle Association, the largest and most influential of the gun rights lobby
                    groups, has been similarly silent after each massacre and the murder figures themselves are
                    astounding comparing to the United kingdom whose murder average is around 550 per year.</p>

                <p class="long-text">​In 2011, the latest year for which detailed statistics are available - there were 12, 664 murders in the US.
                    Of those murders 8,583 were caused by firearms.
                    <span>The FBI crime statistics </span> are based on reports to FBI bureau and local law enforcement. <span>In conclusion,</span> I am very passionate about the gun debate
                    and this is why I chose this dataset in order to show that if we have that we need to have gun
                    <span>reforms</span> in the
                    <span>United states.</span> This is not a matter of the second amendment rights but rather a matter of life and death, and we need to keep the guns out
                    of the hands of the bad guys.</p>
