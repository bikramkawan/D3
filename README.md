## Line Charts

These are some line charts with different interaction. Please see the demo.

* [Interactive Line Chart Dashboard 1](https://bikramkawan.github.io/D3/LineChart/InteractiveDashboard/index.html) - Some features are

    * User can  pan and zoom
    * User brush for focus and context 
    * User can  add point of interest with circle on top of line 
    * User can  drag the point of interest circle along the line
    
    
  * [Interactive Line Chart Dashboard 2](https://bikramkawan.github.io/D3/LineChart/InteractiveDashboard/index.html) - Some features are

    * User can  pan and zoom
    * User brush for focus and context 
    * User can  add point of interest with circle on top of line 
    
      
  * [Threshold Line Chart](https://bikramkawan.github.io/D3/LineChart/LineWithThresholdValue/demo.html) - Some features are

    * User brush for focus and context 
    * User can specify the threshold value for the color of line. 
    * The value below the threshold will have one color and the value above the threshold will have another color. 
     

## Network Monitoring Dashboard
This dashboard uses parallel coordinates, scatter plot, line charts 

* [Live Demo ](https://bikramkawan.github.io/D3/ParallelCoordinate/index.html) - Some Features
    * User can filter the data in different ways.
    * When user hover over the scatter plot the point of interested will be highlight in all other charts
    * Scoreboard and the line to indicate the point of interest on scatter plot.
